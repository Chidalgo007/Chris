            <h1>CALORIE TRACKER PROJECT</h1>
            <div class="pro col">
                <p>This project aims to provide a simple yet effective calorie tracking application, featuring user
                    login
                    and
                    registration to enable secure access to personal data and exploration of the app's functionalities.
                    Key
                    features include the ability to input and delete food calorie entries, with detailed categorization
                    of
                    calories
                    by meal type, including fat, carbs, and protein. Users can also manage their profiles by inputting
                    and
                    updating their information.
                    The app offers both daily and weekly views of calorie consumption and displays a weekly bar chart
                    for
                    visual analysis of calorie intake. Integration with Apache Derby databases ensures robust data
                    storage,
                    while various APIs are utilized to enhance data sources and functionality. This system provides
                    users
                    with
                    a comprehensive tool to manage their dietary intake, supporting healthier lifestyle choices through
                    detailed tracking and clear visualizations.</p>

                </a>
                <p>For a recent university assignment, I developed a maze and implemented an algorithm to find the
                    shortest
                    path from the entrance to the exit.
                    This project involved using nodes and the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to efficiently navigate
                    through the maze.</p>

            <div class="pro noise">
                <p>In another project, I worked on an image processing task where I had to upload a picture with noise
                    and
                    remove the noise.
                    I achieved this by implementing an algorithm that fills the noisy areas with the median color of the
                    surrounding pixels, effectively restoring the image quality.</p>

            <h1>CELLPHONE VIRUS SIMULATION</h1>
            <div class="pro col">
                <p>As part of a university project, I developed a simulation focusing on virus transmission between
                    cellphones based on proximity. Each cellphone operated independently as a thread within the
                    simulation.
                    The objective was to simulate the spread of a virus among cellphones, with infected devices having a
                    limited time to recover before potentially "dying" or disappearing. Once three or more cellphones
                    were
                    infected, one was randomly chosen to visit a repair shop, sequentially, showcasing the dynamics of
                    viral
                    spread and system maintenance.
                    </br>
                    To interact with the simulation, users could launch the .jar file and dynamically add cellphones
                    using
                    the UP arrow key. Pressing the letter "v" initiated the infection process, randomly selecting a
                    cellphone to become contagious. This project not only demonstrated my proficiency in concurrent
                    programming and simulation design but also underscored my ability to model real-world scenarios
                    using
                    computational techniques.</p>

                <p>This is a simple shooting game featuring enemy spawning and a life display at the top of the screen.
                    The game mechanics allow the player to control the spaceship using the arrow keys and shoot using

            <h1>SNAKE GAME</h1>
            <div class="pro snake">

                <p>As part of my academic endeavors, I developed a classic Snake game that showcased my proficiency in
                    game
                    programming and algorithmic design.
                    This project utilized a point-based system to establish the snake's movement and position, as well
                    as
                    strategically place apples within the game environment.
                    By implementing effective data structures and algorithms, such as linked lists for the snake's body
                    segments and random positioning for the apples, I ensured an engaging and responsive gameplay
                    experience.
                    This endeavor underscored my capability to combine technical skills with creative game mechanics,
                    contributing to my comprehensive understanding of interactive software development.</p>
